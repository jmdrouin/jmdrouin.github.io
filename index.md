**Developer with a generalist mindset.**  
I use code to build apps people enjoy, mischievous logic puzzles, mathematical tools, and playful games for learning.

## Things I Made

### Alcazar (Solo project)
*A sudoku without numbers.*
Enter from one door, exit from another, visit every square once. Each level has a unique solution in this iOS, Android and pen-and-paper puzzle I designed and developed. Players built continuous paths through castle walls under logic constraints, blending elegance with complexity.
Still offline, but I plan to bring it back soon.
**Tools and tech:** For the app: html (canvas), js and Cordova. Level generator: C++. PDF generator: js.
Status: Offline, may return soon
[ðŸ“¸ Screenshots coming soon]

### Manifold (1 & 2) (Solo project)
*The origami mind-bender.*  
Published by Brainwright, with over 100,000 copies sold. I created the original concept, design, and levels for this addictive folding puzzle.  
**Tools and tech:** Lots of paper, js, svg.  
(Link coming soon)

### Mondoku (Lead designer, lead developer)
* Sudoku meets modern art... *
Each row and column must have all the numbers â€” like Sudoku â€” except that the cells have different sizes. I created the original concept, levels, and most of the code.
**Tools and tech:** Apps: Unity, c#. Level generator: C++, js.
