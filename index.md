**Developer with a generalist mindset.**  
I use code to build apps people enjoy, mischievous logic puzzles, mathematical tools, and playful games for learning.

## Things I Made

### Manifold (1 & 2)
*The origami mind-bender.*  
Published by Brainwright, with over 100,000 copies sold. I created the original concept, design, and levels for this addictive folding puzzle.  
**Tech used:** SVG, JavaScript, and lots (and lots) of paper.
